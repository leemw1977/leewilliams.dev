Hi, I’m Lee Williams—a developer, writer, and problem-solver with a passion for technology and creativity. With nearly three decades of experience in IT and development, I’ve built everything from websites and desktop software to security solutions for international organisations.

## What I Do 🚀

### Web Development
I specialise in creating elegant, fast, and secure websites using tools like Hugo, WordPress, and modern front-end frameworks. Whether it's a simple blog or a robust business site, I love crafting solutions that deliver value - but this isn't my day job...

### Cyber Security
As an Information Security Officer with [TopCashback](https://topcashback.co.uk), I’m passionate about protecting their data and systems. From GDPR compliance to defence-in-depth strategies, I help them to stay secure in an ever-evolving threat landscape which would not be possible without the excellent multi-faceted and crazy brilliant team that is backing me up though.

### Writing & Sharing Knowledge
I enjoy documenting my projects and sharing tips to help others navigate the ever-changing tech world. Writing is my way of giving back to the community that’s helped me grow.

## My Journey ✨

I started my tech career in 1998, diving into software development when the web was still young. Over the years, I’ve worn many hats: developer, administrator, and now, security professional. Each role has deepened my love for solving complex problems and helping others succeed.

## Family & Life at Home 🏡

I’m married and a proud parent to three young adults, all of whom inspire me every day. Our household is rounded out by two wonderful cats — Asparagus (aka Gus) and Dorothy (aka Dotty) — so you can expect plenty of cat pics along the way. I love my family deeply, and they are my anchor and motivation in everything I do.

## When I’m Not Coding 🖌️

Outside of tech, I’m a creative at heart:
- 🎭 I perform in local theatre productions.
- 🎸 I play guitar.
- 📚 I’m a fan of Terry Pratchett, science fiction, and history.
- 🎶 Music is a big part of my life, both listening and creating.

## Understanding Myself 🌍

I self-identify as having ADHD and possibly autism. These aren’t labels I use for their own sake, but they give me a framework to research and better understand my place in the world. This journey of self-awareness has helped me grow both personally and professionally.
