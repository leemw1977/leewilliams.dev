# Terraform? That's a puppet show from the 80's right?

I understand your confusion. But, nope. Sorry.

You are thinking of the 80's Gerry Anderson classic Terrahawks - I remember watching it on a Sunday evening at my Great Nan's. Dr "Tiger" Ninestein and his fellow Terrahawks protecting the earth from Zelda (no not that one!).

Anyway I'm getting sidetracked. A better comparison might have be (yes I'm holding with the puppet theme) Star Fleet (NO, not THAT one!), where three vehicles can form up to make a super robot, it is Japanese in origin and called X-bomber there. Well, suffice to say, little Lee could not get enough of it. But now... I've truly digressed... so...

Where were we? Ah yes Terraform.

At it's root, Terraform is an Infrastructure as code language that allows you to build complex infrastructure using principles of good development. This gets you repeatable infrastructure built in ways that allow reusability and modularity. Terraform maintains a state so it can manage the infrastructure to ensure changes are applied predicatably. It supports a wide array of cloud infrastructure, SaaS tools, Virtualbox all sorts!

Best of all it's open source and extensible!
